At the foundation of any programming language are its data types and operators.
These elements determine the kind tasks which can be applied.
Java is strongly typed language and because of that the types are 
very important,the compiler checks the types for compatibility and
this gives the language portability.Every type have certain amount of
operations that can be applied to it.

Java have two general categories of datatypes.

Primitive and reference.Primitive types are normal binary values
and they are not objects.The Reference types are constructed from
primitive types.

The integral primitive types are byte,short,int,long.Those types
are holding whole number binary values.Char is also type which is also
based on the unicode table which also uses primitive type.


The boolean type represents true and false values.
