public class Classes {
    /* Class concept is fundamental part of Java    
Class is basis of the object oriented programming in Java
Within the class is defined data and the code that acts upon data
The class is a logical abstraction until object of that class
is created in the memory.
The general form of the class is:

    class classname{
        //declare instance variables
        type var1,
        type var2,

        //declare methods
        type method1(parameters){
            //body of method
        }

    }
